```
git clone otahina/PowerPoint-Generator-Python-Project
```

## Setup the Secret Key and OpenAI Key üîë


1. The application uses a secret key for session management and an OpenAI key for the GPT-3.5 Turbo API.

You need to set these as environment variables in your terminal. On **Unix/Linux/macOS**, you can do this with the 'export' command:

```
export SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
export OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_key
```
Replace your_secret_key with a secure, random string. Replace your_openai_key with your personal OpenAI key.


On **Windows**, you can do this with the 'set' command:

```
set SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
set OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_key
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Note that these environment variables will only be set for the duration of the terminal session. If you close the terminal and open a new one, you will need to set them again.
